Comments are messages put into the code that tell the reader what portions of the code do.
They are always preceded by a "//".  This tells the program to ignore whatever follows until the comment ends.
For example:

	public class Move : MonoBehaviour {
	
	// This is an example of a comment.  Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
		// This is another example.  The object will move to the left when the Left Arrow key is pressed down.
		if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftArrow)) {
			gameObject.transform.Translate(-.2f,0,0);
		}
	}
	
	//All of these comments will be read but ignored by the program.
}


Syntax is basically the grammar of a coding language.  If the syntax of a block of code is incorrect, an error message
will appear and the code will not be executed.  Proper uses of syntax in C# include:

	Ending all commands with a semi-colon.  Ex:  gameObject.transform.Translate(-.2f,0,0);
	Having an opening and closing parenthesis.  Ex: if (***)
	Always having an opening and closing squiggly bracket.  Ex: void Update () {
								     }
	Comments preceded by a two slashes.  Ex: //This is a comment.
	Capitalizing each individual word in multi-word commands since spaces and underscores are not recognized.  Ex: GetKey, KeyCode, LeftArrow, etc.
